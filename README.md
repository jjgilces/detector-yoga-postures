# CNN with PyTorch - Classifier of Yoga Poses
This project show how to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)using Keras **to classify possses of yoga** from **images**. 
The main idea is create a Neural Network capable to clasify an image in one of the following classes: downdog, plank , tree,  warrior.

**So, here’s a simple pytorch template that help you get into your main project faster and just focus on your core (Model Architecture, Training Flow, etc)**



# Requirements
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) (The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
)
- [Tensorflow](https://pytorch.org/) (An open source deep learning platform) 
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations)
- sklearn (scikit-learn)
- matplotlib
- keras (opcional, dado que estás usando tensorflow.keras) 
- fastai
- seaborn
